# Package types

OFN offers 5 packages, which differ according to the type of enterprise \(producer or hub\) and whether they want to have an online shop. When you first create your profile and login, you’ll be prompted to select a package. Your selection here dictates the functionality that your profile will have i.e. whether you'll just have a profile, or also a shop. Different packages may also have different fee structures, depending on how your local instance charges. The different packages are described below for Producers and Non-Producers \(hubs\).

## For Producers

_\* Note: The above is an example only, fees vary between OFN instances/countries._

1. **Producer profile – connect through OFN: **
   This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you. A producer with a profile can also add products, which may be stocked in OFN shopfronts that are coordinated by others.
2. **Producer Shop- sell your own produce: **
   This option allows producers to create their own OFN shopfront through which to sell their produce. Note that producers can conduct sales through their own shopfront and/or act as a supplier to another shopfront.
3. **Producer Hub- sell produce from self and others:  **
   This option is for producers who wish to sell their own produce, as well and products created by other producers.

If you only want a profile on the OFN, once you've created your account, confirmed your email, and selected a profile-only package, your profile will be live on OFN. If you want to change or add any details to your profile, continue to [Enterprise Settings](/your-profile-adv.md), if not, you're all done.
