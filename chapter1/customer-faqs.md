### A propos d'Open Food France \(OFF\)

%accordion%OFF livre-t-elle des paniers de fruits et légumes ?%accordion%

Pas exactement. OFF est un site internet qui permet aux entreprises respectant notre charte d'avoir un site internet leur permettant de vendre leurs produits. Toutes les boutiques sur le site sont indépendantes et réalisent une activité unique. Certaines vont proposer des paniers, d'autres proposent des commandes à la demande, ou sur un marché. Pour connaitre avec précision le fonctionnement d'une boutique, consultez son profil !

%accordion%En quoi OFF est transparent ?%accordion%

Pour la première fois, vous allez connaitre, pour tous vos achat l'allocation exacte du prix entre la part du producteur et celle du distributeur \(dans notre cas essentiellement des associations, épiceries, coopératives et collectifs de producteurs\). Les utilisateurs d'OFF s'engagent également à renseigner les caractéristiques des produits \(certification biologique, lieu de production...\).

%accordion%En quoi faire ses achats sur OFF est bénéfique à l'environnement, aux producteurs ou à mon quartier ?%accordion%

OFF donne de la visibilité aux producteurs en leur donnant de la reconnaissance et un prix juste. Un système alimentaire indépendant des grandes multinationales et permettant les échanges directs avec les producteurs au sein de communautés locales permet à ces mêmes communautés de profiter des bénéfices et accentue les liens entre les membres. Faire ses courses localement a un impact environnemental réduit au travers des émissions liées au transport évitées, ainsi que via les produits consommés, respectants d'avantages les saisons.

%accordion%How is the OFN different to other online food delivery services?%accordion%

The OFN is not for profit and committed to building a better and fairer food system. Some online stores still source through conventional supply chains which are shrouded in mystery, but on the OFN you can always see where your food has come from.  The OFN is also contributing to something bigger. The code for the OFN software is free for others to use, so is contributing improving food systems all over the world.

### Placing orders

%accordion%What are order cycles?%accordion%

Some shops operate their ordering and delivery in ‘order cycles’, as opposed to shops which are perpetually open and process orders on a one-by-one basis. Order cycles are a way for enterprises to process orders in bulk, which makes their business more efficient, so they can pass on savings to you \(think how inefficient it would be for a farmer to harvest a lettuce each time an order is placed\).

An order cycle starts with a period of time when the shop is open and accepts orders. Then it will close, and the shop will process \(harvest, pack and deliver\) all of the orders that were placed. This process will then repeat itself. A full order cycle might take 2 weeks \(e.g. the shop is open for 10 days, and then orders are harvested, packed and delivered in 4 days\). For customers, this can mean that you will place your order a few days to a week before your order is delivered. Once you get used to ordering in advance like this, and planning your shopping ahead, the system works well, and brings you the freshest goodies!

If you see that a shop is closed, just return back when their next order cycle is open to start shopping with them.

%accordion%How are orders delivered?%accordion%

All online shops on the ONF are independently operated and offer different shipping methods. Some shops offer more conventional shipping methods like home delivery, or postage. Others will have more creative ways for getting the food from the farmer to plate, such as collection from a central location \(like a school, farmer’s market or workplace\), collection from a neighbourhood grocer or butcher or distribution through a buying group \(group of customers\).

%accordion%What are buying groups and how can I join or establish one?%accordion%

A buying group is a collective of customers, who place a bulk order through a shop, then receive and distribute the order amongst members. This might take place in someone’s back shed, or local community space. Buying groups are often not for profit and run by members. By ordering in bulk, and taking on the task of packing and distributing individual orders, members of a buying group can access great produce at lower prices. Joining or starting a buying group with your neighbours or community group can be a great way to access affordable produce and also build  sense of community.

If a shop delivers to a buying group, ask them about how you can join. Or if you want to start a new buying group, get in touch with a shop to see if it can be accommodated, and talk with your community to get others involved.
