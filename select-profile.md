# 2. Choose profile type

_Time_: 5 min

Here you can select the ‘type’ of profile you want, based on the functions it needs to have.  

### **Your starting point**
- I didn’t do anything yet, except from reading this userguide → go to step 1
- I have clicked the ‘confirm email address’ link, directing me to the profile types page → go to step 2
- I want to change my profile or account type → [go here](select-profile/change-account.md)

### **Steps**
**1.** Log into the [Administration Panel](https://openfoodnetwork.org.au/admin) **OR** Click on the cog in the top right hand side of the homepage and select ‘Administration’.

**2.** Select the type of profile you want and click the 'start' button


If you are **a producer**, these are your options:

1. **Producer profile – connect through OFN: **
This option allows you to create a profile on the OFN. Your profile is a way for you to share your story with others and makes you visible and contactable to customers and other enterprises who may wish to trade with you. A producer with a profile can also add products, which may be stocked in other OFN shopfronts.
2. **Producer Shop- sell your own produce: **
This option allows producers to create their own OFN shopfront through which to sell their produce. Note that producers can conduct sales through their own shopfront and simultaneously act as a supplier to another shopfront.
3. **Producer Hub- sell produce from self and others: **
This option is for producers who wish to sell their own produce, as well and products created by other producers.
