## Open your shop!

The last step is to open your shop. You do this by setting a duration of time when you want your shop to be **open** and accepting orders. As well as when it will **close**, to process (harvest, pack and deliver) all of the orders that were placed. This process will then repeat itself. We call this an **order cycle**.

Each time an order cycle is created, you can select which products to stock in the store.

#### Create order cycles
Order cycles behave slightly differently for producers selling their own products, and hub shops who sell produce from multiple suppliers. Go to:

[Order Cycles for producers](/order-cycles-for-producers.md) if you are a producer.
[Order Cycles for hubs](/order-cycles.md) if you are **not** a producer.
